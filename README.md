# NIM GAME

In NIM game, two players take turns remove bricks from one of the rows that appear (the number of rows vary among levels). Players must remove at least one brick in their turn. The goal of the game is to take the last brick.

In my game, players can choose 1 of 3 play modes as follows:
  1. Player VS Player
  2. AI VS Player
  3. SmartAI VS Player

Players are able to choose who will be take the first turn:
  1. The first player
  2. The second player

During the game, players can use "Star" to skip their turn. It can be used only one time.
