# NIM GAME

In NIM game, two players take turns removing objects from distinct piles. On each turn, a player must remove at least one object, and may remove any number of objects provided they all come from the same pile. The goal of the game is to take the last object.

In my game, players can play in different modes:
  1. Human VS Human
  2. AIPlayer VS Human
  3. SmartAIPlayer VS Human

Players can also choose who will go first:
  1. The first player
  2. The second player
  3. Randomly
